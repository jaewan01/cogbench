"Absolute magnitude: Increased preference for delayed gains when values become substantially larger, even when relative differences are constant (for example, prefer $500 now over $550 in 12 months and prefer $5,500 in 12 months over $5,000 now4,7).

Gain–loss asymmetry: Gains are discounted more than losses, though differences (real and relative) are constant (for example, prefer to receive $500 now over $550 in 12 months, but also prefer to pay $500 now over paying $550 in 12 months).

Delay–speedup asymmetry: Accepting an immediate, smaller gain if the delay is framed as added value, but preferring the larger, later amount if an immediate gain is framed as a reduction (for example, prefer to receive a gain of $500 rather than wait 12 months for an additional $50 and prefer to wait for 12 months to receive $550 rather than to pay $50 and receive the gain now).

Present bias: Lower discounting over a given time interval when the start of the interval is shifted to the future (for example, prefer $500 now over $550 in 12 months and prefer $550 in two years over $500 in 12 months)."

3baselines = 5 + 4 anomalies which only score 1 or 0! hence 0->19 and then I standardize btwn -1 and 1?

#! for the following engines: hf_Llama-2-7b-longlora-16k-ft hf_Llama-2-7b-longlora-32k-ft hf_Llama-2-7b-longlora-100k-ft
I hardcoded for now score of 8 just to see UMAP (was the score for the 8k-ft so felt okay at the time), but change when I can!
