class TwoArmedBandit4Context_ExpForLLM(Experiment):
    """
    This class represents an experiment for the 2-armed bandit task with 4 contexts. It extends the base Experiment class.
    The experiment is designed to be run with an LLM. The LLM is used to generate choices in each trial of the task.

    Attributes:
        get_llm (function): A function that returns an LLM object.
        arms (list): List of engines to use.
        num_runs (int): Number of runs.
        version_number (str): Version number of the experiment.

    Methods:
        add_arguments_(): Adds additional arguments to the parser.
        run_single_experiment(llm): Runs an LLM on a single experiment of the 2-armed bandit task with 4 contexts.

    The class inherits from the Experiment class. It overrides the `__init__` method to add additional arguments to the parser and the `run_single_experiment` method to run the 2-armed bandit task with the given LLM.

    The `run_single_experiment` method simulates a 2-armed bandit task using the given LLM. It generates a prompt for each trial, lets the LLM choose an action, and then steps into the next trial.
