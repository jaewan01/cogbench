        This function simulates a step in the urn experiment. It randomly selects an urn based on `self.left_prob` and then draws a ball from the selected urn.

        Parameters:
        left_urn (str): The identifier for the left urn.
        right_urn (str): The identifier for the right urn.

        The function first spins a "wheel of fortune" to decide which urn to draw from. If a random number is less than `self.left_prob`, it selects the left urn and sets `red_prob` to `self.red_prob`. Otherwise, it selects the right urn and sets `red_prob` to `1 - self.red_prob`.

        Then, it draws a ball from the selected urn. If a random number is less than `red_prob`, it observes a red ball. Otherwise, it observes a blue ball.

        Returns:
        obs (str): The color of the observed ball ('red' or 'blue').
        urn (str): The identifier of the urn from which the ball was drawn.
